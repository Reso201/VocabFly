    <h1>Team Profile</h1>
        <h2>Team Name</h2>
            <p align="justify">Our team's name is Omada. The reason why we decided to choose this name is because in Greek, “Omada” means a team, the name underlines our belief that efficient teamwork will creates extraordinary results. With the power of cooperation and partnership, we will never walk alone and achieve many things together. </p>
        <h2>Personal information </h2>
            <p align="justify">I am Le Duc Huy from team 4. I graduated high school in 2020, therefore, this is my third year at RMIT with student number is s3877607. I chose Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering as my major since my sister, an alumnus, said that RMIT have a good environment and equipment to develop in this area. I like to play a variety of sports; I also like to play games during my free time with friends. My IT interest is in robots and automation. I have some background in high school, but I want to improve and expand my knowledge about IT in the future.</p>
            <p align="justify">My name is Le Trung Hieu, my sID is 3877456, I am studying Robotics engineering as a third-year student. I have a deep passion for robots and manufacturing parts related to mechanical engineering hence RMIT is my first stepping place to study to achieve my goal. I love to play badminton and table tennis, but anything involved with friend’s activities would also delight me. My IT interest is in robots and automation. I may not have talent in physics and chemistry, but I wish to pursue to become better at it, therefore improving and enlarging my vision in study of IT is my priority. </p>
            <p align="justify">My name is Chu Uyen Nhi (S3836517); I am currently studying Bachelor Program at RMIT Viet Nam with a major in International Business and a minor in Digital Marketing. My newest hobby is trekking; I discovered it when I had a chance to experience Lao Than mountain trekking with my high school friends one year ago. Since then, I have completed three more routes in North-East Vietnam. My primary motivation in studying IT is finding out how artificial intelligence can be used creatively and effectively in our daily lives to help people reach further our abilities. I have some basic IT background from high school, but it seems like it is not up to date anymore. Although IT is not my main major, I consider this course a good opportunity to enrich my knowledge of IT. </p>
            <p align="justify">My name is Luu Van Nghia (s3986571), I am working on Bachelor of Information Technology. The reason for me to join the course is the passion about making machines work by coding, and I am trying my best to achieve the goal. I just discovered my passion when I was studying at Marie Curie high school in Robotic class, they only teach us how to make it work by using a computer, but they never show the code which is the crucial factor to control the robots perfectly, and that unintentionally stimulated my curiosity about programming. I'm eager to use what I've learned in practical situations and work with like-minded people to develop original solutions. I've become even more passionate about programming, and I'm determined to improve my abilities and push the envelope of what's feasible. </p>

        <h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
            <p align="justify">In our group, we all aim to reach higher knowledge in IT aspects, and as a steppingstone to achieve a different goal seeing IT as a foundering cognition. Specifically, Hieu and Huy are working in robotics major hence their study goal and aim are towards machine learning and resolves around mathematics. Nghia aimed more into programming, leading to many concepts such as coding, data sorting and website development. And Nhi, although she chose to study business and despite lack of depth comprehension of advanced tech, would wish to pursue artificial intelligence to plot her ideas and enrich understanding of IT. Despite that, we all use IT as substructure to enhance us comprehension around technologies and work toward ideal jobs.</p>

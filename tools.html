        <p>Our team has created a static web page that is based on the content of the report. Based on the Git repository, we can clearly see that our workflow was divided into three stages: completing the report content, defining the website’s content, structure and layout, and styling and modifying the website.
        <br>In the first stage of the project, Huy Le shared a Word Online to collaborate with other on the report content. We worked together to gather the necessary information, research, and write the report.
        <br>In the second stage, our main web developer, Huy, was responsible for defining the structure and layout of the static website. He collaborated with Hieu and Nghia, who acted as a supervisor, to help with the development process, using the report's structure as a guide for adding all the necessary content in HTML format. Together, we created the basic structure and layout of the website, added headings, sections, and images. Hieu, Nghia, and Nhi helped with completing the report content, ensuring that all information and research were up-to-date and accurate. 
        <br>Overall, our team's Git repository proved to be a crucial resource for our project, offering a precise and transparent record of our work as we went along and a means of monitoring both the project's advancement and each team member's contribution.

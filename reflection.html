    <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Huy Le</H3>
        <p align="justify">Iâ€™m very happy that we have finished our project. Everyone is ready to do what ever the work that are divided to them. Whether is coding or writing report, the are no complain and the output is quality. One thing makes me surprise is the deadline from the task coordinator is not very effective when all the work is done beforehand. All of us thought that if we could finish this fast, we all going graduate, since this is my last year of university. The fact that our members work on the project at different times can be a slight annoyance, though. For example, although some of our members would rather work on the project until late at night, I would rather finish it early in the morning. Some days, I have to work on the task till the evening before I can make the inquiry. 
        <br>In conclusion, working on the project with my teammates gave me a ton of experience. I was relieved and content when our group completed the project effectively. I gained confidence in my ability to create a game, improved my collaborative skills, and expanded my understanding of programming, planning, and exhibiting proficiency as a result of this project.</p>

    <h3>Hieu Le</H3>
        <p align="justify">I am very satisfied with the project aim to promote a product, it helps me what I am lacking and capable when working with a team, for the future teamwork in a company. Since we are students with discipline, it is easy to track and follow guidelines to author the report and finish it without delay. However, it does not prove that i am capable of working in a different environment. Another major point was we finished the report before deadlines whereas other teams still struggled with wordings and ideas to write, this shows my team working skill had enhanced gradually within these weeks. If i can keep up with the excellent work and pursue my goal with new skills, I can finish tasks more efficiently and shorten the time needed to overdo at night.
        <br>Overall, experiences with working with my teammates had been a journey and i am relieved to see the project went smoothly without many errors need for correcting. With this confidence, i hope i can work in any team without any issues of communication or lack of pursuit on the project, and with good leadership skills, programming, coding, and collaborating activities, i can work towards my aim with ease.</p>

    <h3>Nhi Chu</H3>
        <p align="justify">First of all, thanks to my teammate for the collaboration on the wonderful project, we have been working on; the teamwork progress went through a kind of flow with minor difficulties. Each of us might not come from the same major in technology, but it has both advantages and disadvantages: various perspectives and knowledge that enhance our insight and complete the game at our best. However, the downside of this is the rush time and the difference in each schedule, which somehow extends the deadline we set to complete the project before the due date. Despite the effort to book the appointment with all members, we try to take advantage of every virtual tool we can, like continuously reviewing and commenting on each other sections whenever we have time. I genuinely think that we also stepped up our personal and teamwork skills when we had to spend many nights refining our skills and catching up with the project.
        <br>Ultimately, the teamwork has brought a fresh experience for me as the person who always prefers doing solo work. From all those disagreements and discussions, I think I have learned the power of teamwork if we do it properly with an open mindset and willingness to learn. Besides technical skills, collaborative skills such as communication and management are crucial parts that can determine the success of the project.</p>

    <h3>Nghia Luu</H3>
        <p align="justify">I am thrilled with how effectively my group collaborated on this group assignment. We had a clear goal and split work, controlled our time, and communicated on a regular basis. Each team member executed their jobs efficiently and on schedule, and we all worked together to ensure the project was finished effectively. However, we should have done a better job of managing team members' diverse work/life schedules and not allowing personal concerns to interfere with project execution. Our crew's productivity was also a nice surprise, as we completed assignments ahead of time. I also learnt the value of successful team cooperation, clear communication, and adaptability. Overall, this project was a valuable and educational experience that helped me to develop my skills and understanding.</p>

    <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
    <p align="justify">Works were divided equally and based on each individual specialty, no complaints were made during each session of team meetings, no innovative ideas and help assistant were raised and were responded accordingly, respectfully to each talk. We are satisfied with the working progress and how well teammates behave even if disagreement were found in different ideas. There were some occasions where the design was overlapping with each other's due to common misunderstandings, we had a plan to list out the pros and cons of each plan and combine the finalize a final product to added to the report.
    <br>
    <br>However, since few of us were able to meet up at the time given, we tend to be about 15 minutes late or sometimes another issue arose which blocked our meetings from being full, a solution was given such as writing notes and recording for those who were absent. With each person working at home, when planning a GitHub prototype for the report, we wished to have more time together to spot more practical branches and reviewing bugs to learn the issue more accordingly. 
    <br>
    <br>The project was a big step for each of us, due to the different major we are studying that could not contribute fully to our understanding and had to rely on websites and books as well as lectures to assist on creating the product. The concept GitHub was a new experience where it involves git command and HTML, and many trials and errors were made during each session. However, we overcame the difficulties and consulted with many experts in these aspects to help us finish the work.
    <br>
    <br>After this project, we have gained an insight on how to communicate correctly, connect new friends in different majors, bonding ideas whether conflicting or not, working on pressure with multiple deadlines were occurring. And based on the events of the issue, we had learned to be flexible in many situations and tackle it with better solutions which fit with the team and individual. There had been time where we let our rage of unfinished work on loose take control, but in the end with a bit of time to cooldown and assist of teammate, we manage to plot the hole missing in the report and learn that although some tasks given were not to your ideal learning and you found it hard to solve, there are still teammate to help you with, and that is the benefits of working in a team.

        <p align="justify">Iâ€™m very happy that we have finished our project. Everyone is ready to do what ever the work that are divided to them. Whether is coding or writing report, the are no complain and the output is quality. One thing makes me surprise is the deadline from the task coordinator is not very effective when all the work is done beforehand. All of us thought that if we could finish this fast, we all going graduate, since this is my last year of university. The fact that our members work on the project at different times can be a slight annoyance, though. For example, although some of our members would rather work on the project until late at night, I would rather finish it early in the morning. Some days, I have to work on the task till the evening before I can make the inquiry. 
        <br>In conclusion, working on the project with my teammates gave me a ton of experience. I was relieved and content when our group completed the project effectively. I gained confidence in my ability to create a game, improved my collaborative skills, and expanded my understanding of programming, planning, and exhibiting proficiency as a result of this project.</p>

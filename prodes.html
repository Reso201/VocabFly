    <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4>&nbsp Topic and Motivation</h4>
            <p align="justify">In today’s modern society, technology, particularly smartphones, have become a part of human’s life, including children. Besides making people’s life become more convenience in many aspects like contacting, researching information and so on, it also brings back. As Penelope Leach – A British psychologist specializes in child development research and writing on parenting topics said that, “For a small child there is no division between playing and learning; between the things he or she does ‘just for fun’ and things that are ‘educational.’ The child learns while living and any part of living that is enjoyable is also play.” [1]. So instead of keeping the phone out of their range, we want to change the way they use their phones for educational purpose by making a video game called VocabFly- inspired by a side-scroller game Flappy bird and Duolingo, an app which most people use to learn English. At main interface, players will choose the topic and level they want to play from easy to hard, then a notification will appear for players to confirm their selection and start the game. The gameplay will be a little harder from the original Flappy bird because we will add a picture on top-left corner and two gates which contain an English word relate to the picture and only one of those are correct, players have three times to choose the answer for every level, so they must try to control the bird to fly into the correct gate as much as they can to finish the level. Otherwise, the game will reset, show them the correct answer and save their highest point as a new record. The only weakness of this game is the limitation of the vocabulary, comparing to learning apps like Duolingo or Quizzlet, we can only provide the basic words to help children get to know about some topics like transportations, animals, household appliances, furniture, and school supplies.</p>

                <h4>&nbsp Plans and Progress</h4>
                    <p align="justify"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA clear plan must unquestionably be the foundation of any project. Because of this, our team had to spend a week coming up with a plan that worked for everyone's schedules and ability levels. We have realized that errors will always occur in projects of all sizes, thus regardless of the scope, we have prepared for the worst-case situations and are ready to handle any issues that may arise in line with our risk assessment. But there had been unpredictable events that meant we had to spend days and nights adjusting the strategy. This part will describe the actions we took to put the strategy into action, detail will be discussed in the Timeframe section, as well as the enhancements we made to guarantee the game’s functioning. We divided the project into 3 phases: Preparation, Building, Testing and Reflection.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the first phase, our group split apart the project's components that needed to be researched, such the necessary skill and the tool to utilize. These duties were completed good, but we found out that the scope of a project is its most crucial component, which we must carefully examine. We initially confused scope with a project's landscape, but after speaking with our mentor, we understood that scope also refers to deliverable elements and complex functionality that are included in scope and out of scope, respectively. The timeline for our events was difficult because it was revised three times in addition to the modifications. In the first version, we made a huge mistake in naming our events and selecting the objectives, which made our schedule difficult to understand. As a result, following several meetings, our final schedule with realistic deadlines, weekly objectives, work allocations for every member, and thorough task descriptions became clearer. It took us 22 days to finish our proposal since we had to read more information that were relevant to our plans. 
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSelf-learning web development languages and technologies like HTML, CSS, and Python was another aspect of this time. The development team mostly used this section to familiarize themselves and practice for five straight days. It is imperative to invest a significant amount of time in this learning process because our team was expected to use HTML to specify the structure and layout of the website, CSS to create visually appealing styles for the website, and Python to build interactive features like search engines and database integration as well as web APIs. Before starting, our team was initially overwhelmed by the amount of code that went into every aspect of a website, but with the help of the engaging and instructional resources available on the w3school website, we were able to gradually grasp both basic commands and more complex features like color matching, sorting algorithms, and website layout. As this was going on, our team delegated other people to do vocabulary research. English, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese are the five languages that are being searched and recorded. Our game has more than a thousand words in each language. Finding the right image for the text took us five days, and it was not as simple as it seemed. Finally, our team were well preparing and ready to moving to the exciting second phase, which is building the VocabFly.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the second phase, Building, each person will be given an object to create. For the background and character design, Hieu use Paint and some objects image, such as, trees, bushes, sky, and ground for the game background. Combine all together, we will have the complete background. However, when it came to styling the background with CSS, we faced some challenges. These included deciding on the font to use, choosing the right color combination, determining the position of each element on the page, and ensuring that the overall design was visually appealing and user-friendly. In order to overcome these issues, we spent a day researching various background and watching YouTube tutorials to learn more about styling and proportion. Despite the delay, we were able to improve our understanding of these concepts and are now better equipped to create a visually appealing and functional background. For character, based on the image of a bird combine with hats and colors, we design 2 birds, boy and girl.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe next thing to be create is the sound of the game. In this area, Nghia played some simple notes on piano with melody to get some noise for the game. This is not very hard to make and will make the game have some rhythm to interest the user experience. The vocabulary was already found in the previous phase. In this phase, the vocabulary will be put in font and place on the trap door, where the bird fly through. Nhi will responsible for choosing word that appear in each situation where the picture appears. The correct door will match with the picture and the wrong will be randomize.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen the game starts, the menu will appear first. For this part, Huy will make button for user to use and go to the desired page. There will be 2 buttons for the first page, ‘Start game’ and ‘Settings’. Setting will help user to adjust the volume of the sound, choose which bird user want to use, or choose the language for the menu. Start game will lead the user to another page, where user can choose the language of vocabulary want to learn, and the categories of the vocabulary. After all the choice are set, the game will start. All of this will be create using Python. Using libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library), Matplotlib, or OpenCV to display an image of button. To change the page according to the button, hyperlink can be use. We will set the button to be a hyperlink to the page that match with the description, so that user can change to the page they want. For the game, our idea is to create the obstacle that have only 1 space to get through, and that is where we put the trap door with correct answer on it. If the player chooses the wrong answer trap door, they will hit the obstacle and lose. This can be done by Python code with lots of online resource that we can learn. The game will continue until the player hit the wrong trap door and the “You lose” page will show up.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithout testing, an IT project cannot be function properly. The next phase we will start to test and fix the game for best user experience. However, we just test our website without a clear direction, such as verifying typing, input, clickable buttons, etc., due to lack of knowledge about quality assurance. As a result, it was quite annoying that new issues may be found at random after every test. After some discussion in which we categorized test cases according to our findings, a more official list of testing kinds was created. Functionality, usability, user interface, performance, security, compatibility, mobile friendliness, and beta testing were all on the list. Since the additions and problem fixes could be grouped into different testing kinds, it was not required to go through the entire list every time there was an update. We decided to run test individually for different result, each time will be led by one person, that person will have the responsibility to test all points on the list, report and fix. Then the next person will do the same. The process repeats three times and the last person will finalize and release the game. 
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the final phase, we will create a forum for player to chat, upload, and give feedback for our game. After receive the feedback, we will have a discussion on how well have we done on the project, is it meet to our goal at the start of the project, and we will have a reflection on it. This will help us understand more about our role in this project, what we learn from this, and how it helps us in the future career.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp Roles</h4>     
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe agree that the work should be equally divided to everybody in order to keep everyone understand the project. However, there should be a member act as a coordinator to keep team on track. Therefore, we decided to divide the building and testing phases into two primary flat structure.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp Scope and Limits</h4>



            
            <h4>&nbsp Tools and Technologies</h4>




            <h4>&nbsp Testing</h4>




            <h4>&nbsp Timeframe</h4>      
            <h5><u>Preparation Phase</u></h5>
            <img src="./pic\pre.png" alt="Preparation Phase">
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur team will spend five weeks for the first phase, the preparation/research phase, researching project fundamentals, learning how to create websites, and writing project proposals. The start of the first week is to discuss and do some research on the topic. Then we spend next 4 weeks to complete the project proposal, due to the difficulties of the report, we have to rewrite it three times to fulfill all the requirement of the project. After the project have been submitted, some of us will spend the next 5 days to learn and get familiar with the tools, practice the skills that require for create the game, other will find and record the vocabulary for 5 different languages.</p>

            <h5><u>Building Phase</u></h5>
            <img src="./pic\bul.png" alt="Building Phase">
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis phase will take the most time to complete, which take 7 weeks to create the game. For the first week, we divided 4 different objects for each member to create: 
                <br>-	Background and Characters: Hieu use Paint and online resource to make in 4 days
                <br>-	Sound: Nghia use piano sound to create the background music in 4 days
                <br>-	Vocabulary: Nhi choose the combination between word and picture for the game in 3 days
                <br>-	Menu: Huy code the menu for linking pages and function of buttons on the page using HTML in 6 days
                <br>-	Gameplay: All the group will discuss, learn, and create the game using required tools in 6 weeks. We working and keep updating our programs in the Github repository, but occasionally we made mistakes during the commit and push processes, taking longer than necessary to undo or redo the modifications.</p>
            
            <h5><u>Testing Phase</u></h5>
            <img src="./pic\tes.png" alt="Testing Phase">
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNext phase will take up four weeks to complete, which is Testing phase. Three members will responsibility to test and fix on their own, then give to the next person. The last person will finalize and record all the bugs and errors for improvement. After that the game will be release and week 15 of the project. The final phase is where we take users feedback for reflection. The Reflection phase only take one week but this is crucial in our development and improvement ourself in the future. Taking feedback and reflect not only help us to understand the users, the project we have done, but it also gives us lessons for our upcoming career.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp Risks</h4>



            <h4>&nbsp Group processes and communications</h4>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExcellent communication is considered one of the most essential elements of team collaboration. It allows individuals to give their perspectives from their own experiences, enriching the group’s content. Furthermore, it develops trust and engagement among the members, pushing the team’s productivity so we can expect a qualified outcome for the project.
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBesides the short time we had in the offline lecture class, we were on the same page in hosting more online and offline meetings to achieve a more efficient teamwork process through variaty of communication tools.</p>
            <h5>Online</h5>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMost of the time, we use online collaboration tools as the primary form of communication. The priority options are Messenger and Microsoft Teams since both of them can basically meet our needs the most. It is time-saving and more accessible to organise the appointments between teammates since it does not require a matching schedule and proper destination as long as it is comfortable to work.
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMessenger is the main channel for chatting and asking for updates for the working process. We also keep track of our team’s work on Microsoft Word by updating members’ work in real-time to allow everyone to read and give feedback on each other’s parts. We appreciate and encourage everyone to give out their opinions so the results can fit all member’s expectations. </p>
            <h5>Offline</h5>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFace-to-face meetings are a must-have when discussing something important like topics, research, etc., because offline meetings can quarantine a particular engagement and focus level of us for the group work. The high-concentration meeting helped us come up with the best solution that we were capable of for the project. We choose to stay after the tutorial class for one to two hours once a week, depending on the content we have to discuss at that time. Besides that, we prefer spending as much time as we can to work together after class on campus at different times just in case someone needs help or simply that it can enhance our team engagement. </p>
            <h5>Conflict and Solution</h5>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConflict is a vital and unavoidable component in every teamwork process that can be the breakdown point for the project, so we need to carefully prepare for it and seek a solution as soon as possible. As mentioned, we encourage individual opinions in terms of contribution to the work, but sometimes, it causes a conflict between ideas or orientation opinions, so we will analyse and focus on which is more stick to the rubric of the assignment and the criteria to pick out. 
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn case a group member goes missing in the teamwork process, we will try to reach out to them through the offline tutorial lesson and online platforms like Canvas, Outlook mail, and Teams at least three times to find out the reason for their absence. To be specific, they do not just have to complete their task alone; they have to respond and keep up with the group process, too, so we expect members to update and report their work within two days if they have any problems. Suppose they can not find a way to quarantine their part in the project; in that case, we have to gather and come up with the decision to mail to the lecturer or the course coordinator to report this situation and ask about any suggestions we can make for this issue.</p>

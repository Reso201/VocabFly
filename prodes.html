    <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h4>&nbsp Topic and Motivation</h4>
            <p align="justify">In today’s modern society, technology, particularly smartphones, have become a part of human’s life, including children. Besides making people’s life become more convenience in many aspects like contacting, researching information and so on, it also brings back. As Penelope Leach – A British psychologist specializes in child development research and writing on parenting topics said that, “For a small child there is no division between playing and learning; between the things he or she does ‘just for fun’ and things that are ‘educational.’ The child learns while living and any part of living that is enjoyable is also play.” [1]. So instead of keeping the phone out of their range, we want to change the way they use their phones for educational purpose by making a video game called VocabFly- inspired by a side-scroller game Flappy bird and Duolingo, an app which most people use to learn English. At main interface, players will choose the topic and level they want to play from easy to hard, then a notification will appear for players to confirm their selection and start the game. The gameplay will be a little harder from the original Flappy bird because we will add a picture on top-left corner and two gates which contain an English word relate to the picture and only one of those are correct, players have three times to choose the answer for every level, so they must try to control the bird to fly into the correct gate as much as they can to finish the level. Otherwise, the game will reset, show them the correct answer and save their highest point as a new record. The only weakness of this game is the limitation of the vocabulary, comparing to learning apps like Duolingo or Quizzlet, we can only provide the basic words to help children get to know about some topics like transportations, animals, household appliances, furniture, and school supplies.</p>
            <h4>&nbsp Landscape</h4>
                <p>Our team is developing an engine that aims to provide users with the ability to expand their vocabulary in the form of playing video games. In doing so, we have identified a few competitors in the market, including Duolingo and Quizzlet.
                    <br>
                <br>However, we believe that our platform has a few special qualities that set us apart from these rivals, including:
                <br>-	Vocabulary expansion: This feature would be helpful for players to remember synonyms better by choosing the words through the game, and they are going to learn it by heart without feeling like they are studying. 
                <br>-	Stimulate curiosity: Another purpose of making this game is to make people curious about another word. When they choose the correct word and start the next gate, they might want to know about the other one, which is the wrong answer. Then they may do some research on the internet and get a huge amount of vocabulary by doing this.
                
                </p>

                <h4>&nbsp Plans and Progress</h4>
                    <p align="justify"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA clear plan must unquestionably be the foundation of any project. Because of this, our team had to spend a week coming up with a plan that worked for everyone's schedules and ability levels. We have realized that errors will always occur in projects of all sizes, thus regardless of the scope, we have prepared for the worst-case situations and are ready to handle any issues that may arise in line with our risk assessment. But there had been unpredictable events that meant we had to spend days and nights adjusting the strategy. This part will describe the actions we took to put the strategy into action, detail will be discussed in the Timeframe section, as well as the enhancements we made to guarantee the game’s functioning. We divided the project into 3 phases: Preparation, Building, Testing and Reflection.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the first phase, our group split apart the project's components that needed to be researched, such the necessary skill and the tool to utilize. These duties were completed good, but we found out that the scope of a project is its most crucial component, which we must carefully examine. We initially confused scope with a project's landscape, but after speaking with our mentor, we understood that scope also refers to deliverable elements and complex functionality that are included in scope and out of scope, respectively. The timeline for our events was difficult because it was revised three times in addition to the modifications. In the first version, we made a huge mistake in naming our events and selecting the objectives, which made our schedule difficult to understand. As a result, following several meetings, our final schedule with realistic deadlines, weekly objectives, work allocations for every member, and thorough task descriptions became clearer. It took us 22 days to finish our proposal since we had to read more information that were relevant to our plans. 
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSelf-learning web development languages and technologies like HTML, CSS, and Python was another aspect of this time. The development team mostly used this section to familiarize themselves and practice for five straight days. It is imperative to invest a significant amount of time in this learning process because our team was expected to use HTML to specify the structure and layout of the website, CSS to create visually appealing styles for the website, and Python to build interactive features like search engines and database integration as well as web APIs. Before starting, our team was initially overwhelmed by the amount of code that went into every aspect of a website, but with the help of the engaging and instructional resources available on the w3school website, we were able to gradually grasp both basic commands and more complex features like color matching, sorting algorithms, and website layout. As this was going on, our team delegated other people to do vocabulary research. English, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese are the five languages that are being searched and recorded. Our game has more than a thousand words in each language. Finding the right image for the text took us five days, and it was not as simple as it seemed. Finally, our team were well preparing and ready to moving to the exciting second phase, which is building the VocabFly.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the second phase, Building, each person will be given an object to create. For the background and character design, Hieu use Paint and some objects image, such as, trees, bushes, sky, and ground for the game background. Combine all together, we will have the complete background. However, when it came to styling the background with CSS, we faced some challenges. These included deciding on the font to use, choosing the right color combination, determining the position of each element on the page, and ensuring that the overall design was visually appealing and user-friendly. In order to overcome these issues, we spent a day researching various background and watching YouTube tutorials to learn more about styling and proportion. Despite the delay, we were able to improve our understanding of these concepts and are now better equipped to create a visually appealing and functional background. For character, based on the image of a bird combine with hats and colors, we design 2 birds, boy and girl.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe next thing to be create is the sound of the game. In this area, Nghia played some simple notes on piano with melody to get some noise for the game. This is not very hard to make and will make the game have some rhythm to interest the user experience. The vocabulary was already found in the previous phase. In this phase, the vocabulary will be put in font and place on the trap door, where the bird fly through. Nhi will responsible for choosing word that appear in each situation where the picture appears. The correct door will match with the picture and the wrong will be randomize.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen the game starts, the menu will appear first. For this part, Huy will make button for user to use and go to the desired page. There will be 2 buttons for the first page, ‘Start game’ and ‘Settings’. Setting will help user to adjust the volume of the sound, choose which bird user want to use, or choose the language for the menu. Start game will lead the user to another page, where user can choose the language of vocabulary want to learn, and the categories of the vocabulary. After all the choice are set, the game will start. All of this will be create using Python. Using libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library), Matplotlib, or OpenCV to display an image of button. To change the page according to the button, hyperlink can be use. We will set the button to be a hyperlink to the page that match with the description, so that user can change to the page they want. For the game, our idea is to create the obstacle that have only 1 space to get through, and that is where we put the trap door with correct answer on it. If the player chooses the wrong answer trap door, they will hit the obstacle and lose. This can be done by Python code with lots of online resource that we can learn. The game will continue until the player hit the wrong trap door and the “You lose” page will show up.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithout testing, an IT project cannot be function properly. The next phase we will start to test and fix the game for best user experience. However, we just test our website without a clear direction, such as verifying typing, input, clickable buttons, etc., due to lack of knowledge about quality assurance. As a result, it was quite annoying that new issues may be found at random after every test. After some discussion in which we categorized test cases according to our findings, a more official list of testing kinds was created. Functionality, usability, user interface, performance, security, compatibility, mobile friendliness, and beta testing were all on the list. Since the additions and problem fixes could be grouped into different testing kinds, it was not required to go through the entire list every time there was an update. We decided to run test individually for different result, each time will be led by one person, that person will have the responsibility to test all points on the list, report and fix. Then the next person will do the same. The process repeats three times and the last person will finalize and release the game. 
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the final phase, we will create a forum for player to chat, upload, and give feedback for our game. After receive the feedback, we will have a discussion on how well have we done on the project, is it meet to our goal at the start of the project, and we will have a reflection on it. This will help us understand more about our role in this project, what we learn from this, and how it helps us in the future career.</p>

                </p>


            
            <h4>&nbsp Tools and Technologies</h4>
                <p>The application of tools and technology is one of our top concerns to prioritize to maximize our productivity. The suitable tools allow for streamlined workflows and enhanced working experience, contributing to high-quality overall outcomes. The only necessary hardware is a functional computer for coding and design with the software mentioned below:
                    <br>-       HTML for determining the structure and the outline of the website
                    <br>-       CSS for determining and controlling the layout’s style
                    <br>-       Python as the primary tool for game development and building interactive features such as search engines, database integration, and web APIs
                    <br>-       GitHub and GitHub Desktop for storing and managing the project and workflow between teammates during the working process
                    <br>-       Paint for creating digital art for game components
                    <br>Through discussion on the teammates’ knowledge and backgrounds, we expected all members to be capable of using Github and Github Desktop to work on this group’s project. About individuals, Huy, Nghia, Hieu and Nhi are in charge of HTML, CSS and Python, while Hieu’s part also includes Paintwork. In conclusion, the assigned parts were carefully given out so we could utilize our abilities to complete the project at our best.
                    </p>



            <h4>&nbsp Testing</h4>
            <p>To ensure that the app publishes smoothly, we had run different types of testing that fits our product maintenance the most. Due to the majority of engineering students in our group, the testing phase ran perfectly without detecting any malfunction. To each test category, we identify what is most fitting for the application:
            <br><b>Functional testing:</b>
            <br>When downloading an app and initiating the game, users tend to find flaws in these steps to decide whether the game is worth playing or not. Therefore, having accurate and smooth-running screen and transaction seamlessly, every function should work precisely as required.
            <br><b>Interference testing:</b>
            <br>To predict situations like having to tab out to have a phone call or low on battery shut down, we must test how the app responds to each situation and result in a save data game without overgoing restart of the game. 
            <br><b>Website/app testing:</b>
            <br>Links that are uploaded to mobile or any devices should be checked carefully without any anomaly added when open, verifying external and internal links are must for checkup. Any cookies relating to the issue should be informed beforehand and make sure encrypted notification when opening a link.
            <br><b>Content testing:</b>
            <br>We ensure that grammatically and vocabulary check before publishing, all types of face and images will be verified as valid and making sure no lost data is seen when uploading to the main screen.
            <br><b>Performance testing:</b>
            <br>Testing how the app works on screentime loading, time opening until enter sleep mode, function reaction to multiple actions at the time, timeframe fit to the requirement, accessibility on different type of devices. Then evaluate overall performance based on data from user’s logging in.</p>
            



            <h4>&nbsp Timeframe</h4>      
            <h5><u>Preparation Phase</u></h5>
            <img src="./pic\pre.png" alt="Preparation Phase">
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur team will spend five weeks for the first phase, the preparation/research phase, researching project fundamentals, learning how to create websites, and writing project proposals. The start of the first week is to discuss and do some research on the topic. Then we spend next 4 weeks to complete the project proposal, due to the difficulties of the report, we have to rewrite it three times to fulfill all the requirement of the project. After the project have been submitted, some of us will spend the next 5 days to learn and get familiar with the tools, practice the skills that require for create the game, other will find and record the vocabulary for 5 different languages.</p>

            <h5><u>Building Phase</u></h5>
            <img src="./pic\bul.png" alt="Building Phase">
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis phase will take the most time to complete, which take 7 weeks to create the game. For the first week, we divided 4 different objects for each member to create: 
                <br>-	Background and Characters: Hieu use Paint and online resource to make in 4 days
                <br>-	Sound: Nghia use piano sound to create the background music in 4 days
                <br>-	Vocabulary: Nhi choose the combination between word and picture for the game in 3 days
                <br>-	Menu: Huy code the menu for linking pages and function of buttons on the page using HTML in 6 days
                <br>-	Gameplay: All the group will discuss, learn, and create the game using required tools in 6 weeks. We working and keep updating our programs in the Github repository, but occasionally we made mistakes during the commit and push processes, taking longer than necessary to undo or redo the modifications.</p>
            
            <h5><u>Testing Phase</u></h5>
            <img src="./pic\tes.png" alt="Testing Phase">
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNext phase will take up four weeks to complete, which is Testing phase. Three members will responsibility to test and fix on their own, then give to the next person. The last person will finalize and record all the bugs and errors for improvement. After that the game will be release and week 15 of the project. The final phase is where we take users feedback for reflection. The Reflection phase only take one week but this is crucial in our development and improvement ourself in the future. Taking feedback and reflect not only help us to understand the users, the project we have done, but it also gives us lessons for our upcoming career.</p>

            <h4>&nbsp Risks</h4>
                <p>Risks encountered are unavoidable elements in any kind of event which can be managed but not wholly eliminated in reality. Any spontaneous risks can cause unpredictable damage to the project, so the solution here is we have to go ahead with the risks proactively and carefully analyze and plan to minimize the possible damage as best we can. Since then, risk management has been the crucial part of the project's process; we use the risk matrix tool to address them based on the potential effects (S) of risks, and the probability of occurrence (P) of it will be graded from one to three along, meaning the lowest to the highest point in both scales. By multiplying those two, the ranking point will be between one and nine to determine the level of risk impact, which will be our main criteria for the decision-making process. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Through careful discussion, we come up with three main risk categories: operational risk, technical, end user, and in-external issues. A brief summary, preventive solutions or reactive actions, and a ranking of the dangers that we have covered will be included in each section.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Technical risks</h4>
                    <br>Since our main product is an app, the technical issues mainly involve application performance and quality of maintenance. 
                    <br>-	Damaged computers (PxS=3)
                    <br>Numerous factors, including poor maintenance, out-of-date or incompatible parts, etc., could have caused this incident. If this happens, we will organize a technical team to fix the computers; if not, we will buy a new one at a reasonable cost. In order to keep the workflow operating at a reduced capacity during this time, we will use a different computer as the substitute plan.
<br>-	Corrupted files (PxS=2): 
<br>In the case that this happens, our technical staff will look into the files and determine whether they should be deleted, fixed, or recovered. Suppose this file prevents us from conducting business; in that case, we will either use our backup copy or temporarily stop any important but superfluous parts until the problem is resolved. Since most corrupted files can be recovered and revised, we have given this event a severity rating of 2.

<h4>End-users issues</h4>
<br>The risks from this section are mainly relevant to user experience, which we were dedicated to refining at our best to ensure the quality of our products so that we can grade most of them with such a low score based on various preventive plans to avoid damage.
<br>-	Poor documented (PxS=2)
<br>This event might happen when the instructions of the game are not clear enough for such a young-age target customer, which leads to confusion when using it. If this event happens, we will proactively discuss and review our content to fix it as soon as possible.
<br>-	Ineffective user interface (PxS=3)
<br>Suppose there is any feedback about the user-friendliness of our app's interface, such as some unnecessary features or some word suggestions that are confusing; in that case, we will gather the design team and review our code to enhance its quality. We grade this problem as this low because we will work hard on the building and testing phase to maximize our product as best as possible before releasing it.
<br>-	Ineffective education outcome (PxS=6)
<br>This event might happen when we keep track of and analyze our consumer' learning progress and notice the recession in their performance; we have to look into our game's algorithm and seek a more effective solution so the word suggestion can positively impact education performance.

<h4>Crisis – Internal vs External issues </h4>
<br>-	Conflicts (PxS=6)
<br>Any teamwork has to involve conflicts due to the dissent among members; however, based on how serious the problem is, we will have a suitable solution to settle it. As long as it is controllable, we will not prioritize taking legal action against each other; if not, we must deal with it by abiding by the law. 
<br>-	Health problems and Accidents: (PxS=4)
<br>If any team member has poor health, we will prioritize their condition and assign them sick leave prescribed by trustworthy dispensaries. Other people will join to cover the left person's job and try to maintain the operation. In such unexpected events, we all have to offer up our own time to work extra to fulfil the emergency tasks.
We shall search for a recruit or another party to handle the task if there is someone who has an accident because the recuperation process could take many months. If the recruit does well, they will be allowed to stay.
<br>-	External issues:
<br>These issues, which originate from purely external causes such as nature, other people, the government, and society, are the most unexpected of all. Risks from external hazards include storms, floods, earthquakes, and other natural calamities that can catch us off guard at any time. When this happens, two backup copies will be made and kept safe, and only the project manager and one key member are going to have access to them. This solution can make sure our core members, who are expected to be responsible and trustworthy, are the ones who hold the power to recreate the project.



            <h4>&nbsp Group processes and communications</h4>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExcellent communication is considered one of the most essential elements of team collaboration. It allows individuals to give their perspectives from their own experiences, enriching the group’s content. Furthermore, it develops trust and engagement among the members, pushing the team’s productivity so we can expect a qualified outcome for the project.
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBesides the short time we had in the offline lecture class, we were on the same page in hosting more online and offline meetings to achieve a more efficient teamwork process through variaty of communication tools.</p>
            <h5>Online</h5>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMost of the time, we use online collaboration tools as the primary form of communication. The priority options are Messenger and Microsoft Teams since both of them can basically meet our needs the most. It is time-saving and more accessible to organise the appointments between teammates since it does not require a matching schedule and proper destination as long as it is comfortable to work.
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMessenger is the main channel for chatting and asking for updates for the working process. We also keep track of our team’s work on Microsoft Word by updating members’ work in real-time to allow everyone to read and give feedback on each other’s parts. We appreciate and encourage everyone to give out their opinions so the results can fit all member’s expectations. </p>
            <h5>Offline</h5>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFace-to-face meetings are a must-have when discussing something important like topics, research, etc., because offline meetings can quarantine a particular engagement and focus level of us for the group work. The high-concentration meeting helped us come up with the best solution that we were capable of for the project. We choose to stay after the tutorial class for one to two hours once a week, depending on the content we have to discuss at that time. Besides that, we prefer spending as much time as we can to work together after class on campus at different times just in case someone needs help or simply that it can enhance our team engagement. </p>
            <h5>Conflict and Solution</h5>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConflict is a vital and unavoidable component in every teamwork process that can be the breakdown point for the project, so we need to carefully prepare for it and seek a solution as soon as possible. As mentioned, we encourage individual opinions in terms of contribution to the work, but sometimes, it causes a conflict between ideas or orientation opinions, so we will analyse and focus on which is more stick to the rubric of the assignment and the criteria to pick out. 
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn case a group member goes missing in the teamwork process, we will try to reach out to them through the offline tutorial lesson and online platforms like Canvas, Outlook mail, and Teams at least three times to find out the reason for their absence. To be specific, they do not just have to complete their task alone; they have to respond and keep up with the group process, too, so we expect members to update and report their work within two days if they have any problems. Suppose they can not find a way to quarantine their part in the project; in that case, we have to gather and come up with the decision to mail to the lecturer or the course coordinator to report this situation and ask about any suggestions we can make for this issue.</p>
